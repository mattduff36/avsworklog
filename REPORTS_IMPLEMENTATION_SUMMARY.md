## üìù Usage Examples

### Downloading a Report

```javascript
// From Reports page
const response = await fetch(
  '/api/reports/timesheets/summary?dateFrom=2025-10-01&dateTo=2025-10-31'
);
const blob = await response.blob();
// Browser automatically downloads
```

### Fetching Statistics

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/reports/stats');
const stats = await response.json();
console.log(stats.timesheets.weekHours); // e.g., 156.5
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install

\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd avsworklog
npm install
\`\`\`

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the database to be ready (2-3 minutes)
3. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the schema

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

\`\`\`env
# Get these from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
\`\`\`

**Finding your Supabase credentials:**
- Go to your Supabase project
- Click "Settings" (gear icon)
- Go to "API"
- Copy "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### 4. Create First Admin User

1. Go to **Authentication** in Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Add User" > "Create new user"
3. Enter email and password
4. After user is created, go to **SQL Editor**
5. Run this query (replace with your user's ID):

\`\`\`sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE id = 'paste-user-id-here';
\`\`\`

You can find the user ID in Authentication > Users table.

### 5. Run Development Server

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with your admin account.

## Recent Enhancements

- **RAMS documents**: Simplified read flow with explicit **Download**, **Open**, and **Email** actions, and action tracking for how each document was accessed in RAMS PDF exports.
- **Timesheet PDFs**: Driver name now comes from the employee profile and displays correctly in both the top **Driver** field and the footer signature row.

## 📱 PWA Installation & Offline Mode

### Installing on iPhone (iOS)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: PWA only works on the **production site**, not localhost!

1. **Open Safari** (must use Safari, not Chrome)
2. **Navigate to**: [https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk](https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk)
3. **Tap the Share button** ⬆️ (bottom toolbar)
4. **Scroll down** and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. **Tap "Add"** in the top right
6. **Icon appears** on your home screen with "Squires" name

### Installing on Android

1. Open Chrome browser
2. Navigate to [https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk](https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk)
3. Tap menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen" or "Install app"
4. Follow the prompts

### Offline Features

**⚠️ Current Status: Partial Offline Support**

What works offline:
✅ **Create timesheets offline** - saved locally, synced when online  
✅ **Create inspections offline** - queued for automatic sync  
✅ **Automatic sync** - happens seamlessly when connection restored  
✅ **Persistent queue** - survives browser restarts  
✅ **Visual feedback** - offline indicator in navbar shows pending items  

**Known Issue (iOS):**
❌ **Navigation between pages offline** - iOS Safari doesn't load cached pages properly  
❌ **Opening app from home screen offline** - Shows "no internet" message

**What this means**: You can still create forms offline if you're already on the form page, but you can't browse between different pages (like from Dashboard to Timesheets) when offline. This is an iOS Safari limitation we're working to resolve.

### Testing Offline Mode

**Desktop (Chrome):**
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
2. Set throttling to "Offline"
3. Navigate to timesheet/inspection form
4. Create a form - it will queue
5. Set back to "Online"
6. Watch it sync automatically! 🎉

**Mobile (Limited):**
Currently, the offline features work best when you're already on a form page and lose connection. Full offline navigation is not yet working on iOS Safari.

For details on this issue and attempted fixes, see `docs/OFFLINE_PWA_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Development

### Adding New Form Fields

1. Update database schema in `supabase/schema.sql`
2. Update TypeScript types in `types/`
3. Modify form components in `components/forms/`
4. Update validation schemas in `lib/utils/validators.ts`

### Running Tests

\`\`\`bash
npm run lint        # Check code quality
npm run build       # Test production build
\`\`\`

## Deployment

### Production Site

**Live at:** [https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk](https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk)

The application is deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from the `main` branch.

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Add environment variables from `.env.local`
5. Deploy!

Vercel will automatically:
- Deploy on every git push
- Generate preview URLs for branches
- Handle serverless functions
- Configure custom domains

### Update Environment Variables

In Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Settings > Environment Variables
- Add all variables from `.env.local`
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production URL (https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk)

## Troubleshooting

### "User not found" error
- Ensure profile was created in database
- Check Supabase triggers are working
- Manually create profile if needed

### Offline sync not working
- **Must use production site** (https://avsworklog.mpdee.uk) - localhost/dev won't work!
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify service worker is registered: open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Make sure PWA is installed from home screen, not Safari tab

### RLS policy errors
- Verify user role in database
- Check RLS policies in Supabase
- Test policies in SQL Editor

### Build errors
- Run `npm install` again
- Delete `.next` folder
- Check for TypeScript errors

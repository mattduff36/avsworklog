**Sample Data Generated:**
- **5 Employee Accounts** (EMP101-105)
  - John Smith

### 4. ✅ Fixed Actions Page
**Status**: Complete ✅

**Problem**: Actions page was empty despite having inspection defects in the database

**Root Cause**: Sample data script only created inspection items with defects, but didn't create corresponding entries in the `actions` table

**Solution**:
- Updated seed script to automatically create action entries for each defect
- Actions include:
  - Link to inspection and inspection item
  - Title: Vehicle reg + item description
  - Description: Defect comment
  - Random priority level
  - Random status (mostly pending)
  - Created by manager

**Result**: 
- Actions page now displays all inspection defects
- Managers can track and mark defects as actioned
- Priority-based organization
- Statistics dashboard working

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/seed-sample-data.ts`

---

### 5. ✅ Fixed Approvals Page Status Badges
**Status**: Complete ✅

**Problem**: All items in approvals page showed "Pending" badge regardless of actual status

**Root Cause**: Status badges were hardcoded in the component

**Solution**:
- Created `getStatusBadge()` helper function
- Dynamic badges based on actual status:
  - `submitted` → Yellow "Pending" badge with Clock icon
  - `approved` → Green "Approved" badge with CheckCircle icon
  - `rejected` → Red "Rejected" badge with XCircle icon
  - `draft` → Gray "Draft" badge with FileText icon

- **Conditional Action Buttons**:
  - Approve/Reject buttons only show for submitted items
  - Already approved/rejected items only show "View Details"
  - Prevents accidental status changes

**Benefits**:
- Clear visual indication of item status
- Better user experience for managers
- Prevents confusion about which items need attention
- Color-coded for quick scanning

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(dashboard)/approvals/page.tsx`

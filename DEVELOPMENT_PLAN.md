### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Attention
1. **End-to-end workflow testing** - Verify employee ‚Üí manager flow works perfectly
2. **Placeholder pages** - Reports and Admin sections need structure
3. **Code quality** - Ensure extensibility for future forms
4. **Bug fixes** - Any issues discovered during testing

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations

### How to Run Migrations
The project includes an automated migration system that connects directly to Supabase PostgreSQL.

**Requirements:**
- All Supabase credentials must be in `.env.local` (including `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`)

**To run a migration:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-db-migration.ts
```

This script will:
1. Load credentials from `.env.local`
2. Connect to the Supabase database
3. Execute SQL from `supabase/add-did-not-work-column.sql`
4. Report success or failure with detailed error messages

**Creating new migrations:**
1. Create a new `.sql` file in `supabase/` directory
2. Write your migration SQL (use `IF NOT EXISTS` for safety)
3. Update the migration script to reference the new file
4. Run `npx tsx scripts/run-db-migration.ts`

**Recent migrations:**
- ‚úÖ Added `did_not_work` column to `timesheet_entries` table

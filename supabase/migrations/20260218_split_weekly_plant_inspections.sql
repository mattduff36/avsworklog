-- Migration: Split weekly plant inspections into daily inspections
-- For each weekly plant inspection (inspection_date != inspection_end_date, plant_id IS NOT NULL):
--   1. Keep the original row as the Sunday (day 7) inspection
--   2. Create new rows for days 1-6 (Monday-Saturday)
--   3. Move inspection_items, inspection_daily_hours, inspection_photos to the correct daily row
--   4. Update actions to follow moved inspection_items
--
-- This migration is idempotent: it skips inspections already converted (where dates match).

-- Add nickname column to vehicles table
-- Nickname helps technicians easily identify vehicles (alternative to reg_number)

-- Add the nickname column (nullable text field)
ALTER TABLE vehicles

-- Create index for faster nickname searches
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vehicles_nickname ON vehicles(nickname);

-- Backfill nickname data:
-- 1. For vehicles with inspections, use the last inspector's name
-- 2. For vehicles without inspections, use 'ChangeMe'

-- First, set nickname from last vehicle inspection where it exists
UPDATE vehicles v

  SELECT p.full_name
  FROM vehicle_inspections vi

  JOIN profiles p ON p.id = vi.user_id
  WHERE vi.vehicle_id = v.id 
    AND p.full_name IS NOT NULL
    AND p.full_name != ''

-- Then, set 'ChangeMe' for any vehicles still without a nickname
UPDATE vehicles
SET nickname = 'ChangeMe'
WHERE nickname IS NULL OR nickname = '';

-- Verify the changes

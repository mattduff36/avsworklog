## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Create Storage Bucket in Supabase

The photo upload feature requires a Supabase Storage bucket. Here's how to set it up:

#### Step 1: Create Bucket
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"New bucket"**
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `inspection-photos`
   - **Public**: ✅ **Yes** (check this box)
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

#### Step 2: Set Storage Policies (Optional - for more security)

By default, a public bucket allows authenticated users to upload and view files. If you want to add custom policies:

1. Click on the `inspection-photos` bucket
2. Go to **"Policies"** tab
3. Click **"New Policy"**

**Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload inspection photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'inspection-photos' AND
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  );
```

**Policy 2: Allow everyone to view photos**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view inspection photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'inspection-photos'
  );
```

**Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own photos**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own inspection photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'inspection-photos' AND
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  );
```

## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Database Infinite Recursion Error

### Problem
When users log in, they get an error:
```
Error fetching profile: {code: 42P17, message: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"}
```

### Root Cause
The RLS (Row Level Security) policies on the `profiles` table have a circular reference:
- To view profiles, the policy checks if the user is an admin
- To check if user is admin, it queries the profiles table
- To query profiles, it needs to check if user is admin
- **→ Infinite loop!**

### Solution Required
Run the SQL script in Supabase to fix the RLS policies:

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lrhufzqfzeutgvudcowy/sql/new

2. **Copy and paste the contents of:** `supabase/fix-rls-policies.sql`

3. **Click "Run"**

The fix changes the RLS policies to check user roles from JWT metadata instead of querying the profiles table, eliminating the circular reference.

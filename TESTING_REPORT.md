## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Permission Warning Displaying Incorrectly ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED

**Description**: When employees viewed their own timesheets/inspections, a warning message "You do not have permission to view this timesheet/inspection" appeared, even though the data was displayed correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `error` state variable wasn't cleared when successfully fetching data, causing old error messages from previous operations to persist.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `setError('')` at the start of `fetchTimesheet()` and `fetchInspection()` functions
- Added `setLoading(false)` before early return in permission check
- Files modified:
  - `app/(dashboard)/timesheets/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 44, 58)
  - `app/(dashboard)/inspections/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 47, 67)

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Error messages now clear properly on successful data load

---

### Issue #2: Duplicate Timesheet Error - Poor UX ⚠️ → 📝 DOCUMENTED

**Description**: When trying to create a new timesheet for a week that already has one, the system shows error: "Failed to save timesheet" with PostgreSQL error code 23505 (duplicate key constraint violation).

**Root Cause**: Database has a unique constraint on `(user_id, week_ending)`, preventing multiple timesheets for the same week. This is **correct business logic**, but the error message is not user-friendly.

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **Known Limitation** - Functional but needs UX improvement
- The constraint is working as designed (prevents duplicate timesheets)
- Users can't accidentally create duplicates
- Error message could be more user-friendly

**Recommendation for Future Enhancement**:
1. Check if timesheet exists before showing "New Timesheet" form
2. If exists, redirect to edit that timesheet instead
3. Or show a better error message: "You already have a timesheet for this week. Would you like to edit it?"

## 🎯 What's Been Accomplished (October 24, 2025 Session)

### 1. ✅ Fixed Report API Routes **CRITICAL FIX**
- **Problem**: Three report API routes were empty files, causing 405 errors
- **Solution**: Implemented all four Excel report endpoints:
  - **Payroll Report**: Regular vs overtime hours for approved timesheets
  - **Compliance Report**: All inspections with submission statistics
  - **Defects Report**: Inspection items marked as defects
- **Result**: All reports now download successfully as Excel files

### 2. ✅ Added Job Numbers to Timesheet Summary **FEATURE ENHANCEMENT**
- Added `job_number` to timesheet entries query
- Created unique, comma-separated job numbers column in Excel
- Updated all related data structures
- Job numbers now tracked per day and displayed in reports

### 3. ✅ Created Sample Data System **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE**
- **Script**: `scripts/seed-sample-data.ts`
- **NPM Command**: `npm run seed:sample-data`
- **Created**:
  - 5 employee accounts (EMP101-105)
  - 5 vehicles (YX21ABC-YX25MNO)
  - 20 timesheets (4 weeks × 5 employees)
  - 106 timesheet entries
  - 30+ vehicle inspections
  - 16+ defects found
  - 16+ actions created from defects
- **Features**:
  - Realistic working hours (8-10 hours/day)
  - Random job codes
  - Mix of regular work and yard work
  - Some days off
  - Random defects in inspections
  - Automated action creation for defects

### 4. ✅ Fixed Actions Page **CRITICAL BUG FIX**
- **Problem**: Actions page was empty (no data)
- **Cause**: Sample data didn't create action entries for defects
- **Solution**: Updated seed script to automatically create actions for each defect
- **Result**: Actions page now shows all inspection defects as trackable items

### 5. ✅ Fixed Approvals Page Badges **UI BUG FIX**
- **Problem**: All items showed "Pending" badge regardless of actual status
- **Cause**: Hardcoded badge in component
- **Solution**:
  - Created `getStatusBadge()` helper function
  - Dynamic badges based on actual status
  - Color-coded (yellow=pending, green=approved, red=rejected)
  - Conditional action buttons (only show approve/reject for submitted items)
- **Result**: Clear visual indication of item status

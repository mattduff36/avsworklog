## Data Migration

### Migration Script
`supabase/add-vehicle-categories.sql`

**What it does**:
1. Creates `vehicle_categories` table
2. Adds `category_id` column to `vehicles`
3. Inserts default categories
4. Migrates existing `vehicle_type` data to categories
5. Sets up RLS policies
6. Adds indexes for performance

**To run**:
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/add-vehicle-categories.sql
```

## TypeScript Types

### Updated: `types/database.ts`
- Added `vehicle_categories` table types
- Updated `vehicles` table to include `category_id`

### Vehicle Type (with relations)
```typescript
type Vehicle = {
  id: string;
  reg_number: string;
  vehicle_type: string | null;  // Legacy, kept for compatibility
  category_id: string | null;
  status: string;
  created_at: string;
  vehicle_categories?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  } | null;
  last_inspector?: string | null;
  last_inspection_date?: string | null;
};
```

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Everyone** can view categories
- **Admins only** can manage categories
- **All users** can create vehicles (inspections page)
- **Admins only** can update/delete vehicles (admin page)

### Validation
- Registration numbers converted to uppercase
- Duplicate registration prevention
- Category foreign key constraints
- Cannot delete categories in use
- Cannot delete vehicles with inspections

3. **Verify Migration**:
   - Check `vehicle_categories` table exists
   - Check `vehicles.category_id` column exists
   - Check default categories inserted
4. **Deploy Application**
5. **Test**:
   - Admin can view/add/edit vehicles
   - Admin can manage categories
   - Employees can add vehicles in inspections

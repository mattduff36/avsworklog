## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   npm install react-pdf pdfjs-dist mammoth
   ```

2. **Continue with Phase 6-7**: Document viewer with scroll tracking

3. **Test Database Setup**: Ensure migration and storage bucket are configured

---

## 📝 Notes

- Database migration requires manual execution in Supabase Dashboard
- Storage bucket requires manual RLS policy configuration
- All RLS policies are defined in migration SQL
- SignaturePad component already exists and can be reused
- PDF generation components already exist in `lib/pdf/` for reference

---

### ⚡ **Setup Complete! Ready to Test**:

Both migrations have been run successfully:
- ✅ Database tables created
- ✅ Storage bucket created  
- ✅ RLS policies configured

Navigate to `/rams` in your app to test!

**Note**: See `docs/MIGRATIONS_GUIDE.md` for migration documentation

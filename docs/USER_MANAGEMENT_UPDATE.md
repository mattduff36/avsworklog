# User Management Updates - Email & Delete Functionality

## Changes Made

### ✅ Feature 1: Email Address Editing
Admins can now change a user's email address through the Edit User dialog.

#### Backend Changes
**File**: `app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`
- Added new `PUT` endpoint to handle user updates
- Updates both Supabase Auth email and profile email
- Validates email format and permissions
- Provides detailed error messages

#### Frontend Changes
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Enabled email input field in Edit User dialog
- Updated `handleEditUser()` to call PUT API endpoint
- Added warning message about email verification
- Shows validation errors from API

**What Changed:**
- Email field is now **editable** (was previously disabled)
- Warning message: "⚠️ Changing email will require the user to verify their new address"
- Uses proper API endpoint instead of direct database update

---

### ✅ Feature 2: User Deletion
Fixed and improved the delete user functionality.

#### Backend (Already Working)
**File**: `app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`
- `DELETE` endpoint deletes auth user via Supabase Admin
- Prevents self-deletion
- Cascades to profile deletion
- Handles errors gracefully

#### Frontend Fixes
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Fixed self-deletion check: `user.id === currentUser?.id`
- Renamed `user` from `useAuth()` to `currentUser` to avoid naming conflicts
- Delete button properly disables for current user

**What Was Fixed:**
- Delete button now correctly identifies the logged-in admin
- Self-deletion properly prevented (button disabled + API check)
- Delete functionality now works for other users

3. Change the **Email** field to the new address
4. Click **"Save Changes"**

- ✅ Self-deletion prevented (UI + API)
- ✅ Confirmation dialog required
- ✅ Cascading deletion (auth + profile)
- ✅ Related data handled by RLS policies

| "Full name is required" | Missing name | Fill in all required fields |

### Delete Errors
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|

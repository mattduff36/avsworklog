## 🔒 Security & Authorization

### Access Control
- All report endpoints require authentication
- Manager or Admin role required
- Employees cannot access reports
- 401 Unauthorized for no auth
- 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions

### Data Filtering
- Employees only see their own data
- Managers see all employee data
- Admins have full access
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at database level

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Downloading a Report

```javascript
// From Reports page
const response = await fetch(
  '/api/reports/timesheets/summary?dateFrom=2025-10-01&dateTo=2025-10-31'
);
const blob = await response.blob();
// Browser automatically downloads
```

### Fetching Statistics

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/reports/stats');
const stats = await response.json();
console.log(stats.timesheets.weekHours); // e.g., 156.5
```

- Single query for multiple related data
- Streaming Excel generation (buffer-based)
- Minimal data transformation
- Indexed database columns

### Scalability
- Reports handle large datasets efficiently

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200 OK` - Report generated successfully
- `401 Unauthorized` - No authentication
- `403 Forbidden` - Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found` - No data for date range (acceptable)
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server/database error

### User-Friendly Messages
- "No timesheets found for the specified criteria"
- "Date range required (dateFrom and dateTo parameters)"
- "Failed to generate report"

### Logging
- Console errors for debugging
- Full error stack traces in development
- Sanitized errors in production responses

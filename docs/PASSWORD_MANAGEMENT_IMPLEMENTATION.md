# Password Management System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive password management system has been implemented for AVS Worklog, featuring automatic password generation, email notifications, and mandatory password changes on first login.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Password Generation
- **Secure Random Passwords**: Format `Word-Word-#-Word-#` (e.g., `Happy-River-7-Bold-3`)
- Easy to read and type
- High entropy for security
- Generated automatically when admins create users
- Generated when admins reset passwords

### 2. Email Integration (Resend)
- **Welcome Email**: Sent to new users with temporary password
- **Reset Email**: Sent when admin resets a user's password
- Professional HTML templates with branding
- Clear instructions for first login
- Fallback handling if email fails

### 3. Admin User Management
- **User Creation Flow**:
  - Admin enters only email, name, employee ID, and role
  - System generates secure temporary password automatically
  - Password displayed to admin in modal
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Email status indicator
  
- **Password Reset**:
  - New "Reset Password" button (key icon) on each user row
  - Confirmation dialog before reset
  - New temporary password generated
  - Password shown to admin
  - Email sent to user
  
### 4. Forced Password Change
- **First Login Requirement**:
  - Users with temporary passwords must change them on first login
  - Automatic redirect to `/change-password` page
  - Cannot access dashboard until password is changed
  
- **Password Change Page**:
  - User-friendly interface with password requirements
  - Real-time password strength indicator
  - Password match validation
  - Show/hide password toggles
  - Success confirmation before redirect

### 5. Database Schema
- **New Column**: `must_change_password` (boolean) in `profiles` table
- Set to `TRUE` for new users and password resets
- Cleared to `FALSE` after successful password change
- Indexed for faster login checks

## File Structure

### Database
- `supabase/add-password-reset-flag.sql` - Migration script (✅ executed)

### Utilities
- `lib/utils/password.ts` - Password generation and validation
- `lib/utils/email.ts` - Email sending via Resend API

### API Routes
- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - User creation (updated)
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/reset-password/route.ts` - Password reset (new)

### Pages
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx` - User management UI (updated)
- `app/(auth)/change-password/page.tsx` - Password change page (new)
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login with password check (updated)

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
You need to set up the following in your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Resend API Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender@yourdomain.com
```

### Resend Setup Steps
1. Go to https://resend.com and create an account
2. Verify your domain (or use the resend.dev domain for testing)
3. Generate an API key
4. Add the API key to `.env.local`
5. Test by creating a new user

## User Flow

3. Enter:
   - Email address
   - Full name
   - Employee ID (optional)
   - Role (Admin/Manager/Employee)
4. Click **"Create User"**
5. System shows temporary password in modal
6. Copy password or share with user
7. User receives email with password

#### Resetting a User's Password
1. Go to **Admin → Users**
2. Find the user in the table

## Security Features

  "employee_id": "E001",
  "role": "employee"
}
```

## Database Migration Details

**Migration executed**: ✅ October 30, 2025

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS must_change_password BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_must_change_password 
ON profiles(must_change_password) 
WHERE must_change_password = TRUE;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Verify domain is added and verified in Resend dashboard
3. Check `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` matches verified domain
4. Look at server logs for Resend API errors

### Users Not Redirected to Change Password
1. Check database: user should have `must_change_password = true`
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check login page is checking the flag correctly

### Password Requirements Not Met
- Ensure password has: uppercase, lowercase, number, 8+ characters
- Check password strength indicator for guidance

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Password expiry (force change every X days)
- [ ] Password history (prevent reusing old passwords)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Password recovery via email
- [ ] Admin audit log for password resets

## Notes for Developer
- All passwords are hashed by Supabase Auth automatically
- Temporary passwords are only stored in memory during creation/reset
- Email sending is non-blocking - user creation succeeds even if email fails
- Password validation uses standard security best practices

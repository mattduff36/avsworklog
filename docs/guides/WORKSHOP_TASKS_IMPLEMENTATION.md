# Workshop Tasks Module - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** 2026-01-06  
**PRD:** [docs/PRD_WORKSHOP_TASKS.md](../PRD_WORKSHOP_TASKS.md)

---

## Overview

The Workshop Tasks module provides a dedicated interface for workshop staff to log and track vehicle repair work, including inspection defect resolution, proactive repairs, and fault fixes. This module consolidates vehicle workshop activities into a single source of truth.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20260106_workshop_tasks.sql`  
**Runner Script:** `scripts/run-workshop-tasks-migration.ts`

#### New Table: `workshop_task_categories`
- Stores categorization for workshop tasks (Brakes, Engine, Electrical, etc.)
- Fields: `id`, `applies_to`, `name`, `is_active`, `sort_order`, `created_at`, `created_by`, `updated_at`
- Default "Uncategorised" category created automatically
- RLS policies: Anyone can read, only managers/admins can modify

#### Extended Table: `actions`
Added new columns:
- `action_type`: `'inspection_defect' | 'workshop_vehicle_task' | 'manager_action'`
- `vehicle_id`: Direct vehicle reference for proactive tasks
- `workshop_category_id`: Links to workshop_task_categories
- `workshop_comments`: Detailed workshop notes (separate from `logged_comment`)

#### Indexes
- `idx_actions_action_type_status`: For filtering workshop tasks by type and status
- `idx_actions_vehicle_id`: For vehicle-specific task lookups
- `idx_actions_workshop_category`: For category filtering

#### RLS Policies
- Workshop users can SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT workshop tasks (`action_type` IN `inspection_defect`, `workshop_vehicle_task`)
- Managers/admins retain full access to all actions
- Non-workshop users cannot access workshop tasks

#### Data Backfill
- Existing inspection-linked actions marked as `action_type='inspection_defect'`
- Default category assigned to existing defects

---

### 2. Permissions System ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `types/roles.ts`: Added `'workshop-tasks'` to `ModuleName` union
- `lib/utils/permissions.ts`: Added workshop-tasks to manager/admin permission sets
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`: Added workshop-tasks to permission maps
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx`: Added workshop-tasks to navigation permissions

**Permission Backfill:**
- All roles receive `workshop-tasks` permission entry
- Managers/admins: enabled by default
- Other roles: disabled by default (can be granted explicitly)

---

### 3. Dashboard Integration ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/config/forms.ts`: Added Workshop Tasks tile
  - ID: `'workshop'`
  - Icon: Settings (wrench)
  - Color: `'workshop'` (orange/amber)
  - Routes: `/workshop-tasks`

**CSS Styling:**
- `app/globals.css`: Added workshop color tokens
  - `--workshop-primary`: 25 95% 53% (orange)
  - `--workshop-light`: 25 100% 96%
  - `--workshop-dark`: 25 95% 40%
  - Utility classes: `.bg-workshop`, `.text-workshop`, `.border-workshop`

---

### 4. Workshop Tasks UI ✅

**File:** `app/(dashboard)/workshop-tasks/page.tsx`

#### Features Implemented:
- **Permission Check:** Uses `usePermissionCheck('workshop-tasks')`
- **Tabs:**
  - Vehicle Tasks (active)
  - Plant Machinery (disabled, "Coming soon")
  - Tools & Repairs (disabled, "Coming soon")
  - Settings (manager/admin only)

#### Vehicle Tasks Tab:
- **Filters:**
  - Status: All / Pending / In Progress / Completed
  - Vehicle: Dropdown of active vehicles
- **Statistics Cards:**
  - Pending count (amber)
  - In Progress count (blue)
  - Completed count (green)
- **Task List:**
  - Grouped by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
  - Card-based layout with hover effects
  - Vehicle reg, category, source (Manual / From Inspection), status badge
  - Action buttons: Mark In Progress, Complete, Undo
- **Add Task Modal:**
  - Vehicle selection (active vehicles)
  - Category selection (active categories)
  - Workshop comments (min 10 chars, max 500)
  - Validation and error handling
- **Mark In Progress Modal:**
  - Short progress note (max 40 chars)
  - Updates status to `logged`
- **Status Workflow:**
  - Pending → In Progress (requires comment)
  - In Progress → Completed
  - Completed → In Progress (undo)
  - In Progress → Pending (undo)

#### Settings Tab (Manager/Admin):
- **Category Management:**
  - List all categories (active and disabled)
  - Add new category
  - Edit category (name, sort order)
  - Toggle active/inactive
  - Delete category (if not in use)
  - Default "Uncategorised" category cannot be deleted

---

### 5. Inspection Integration ✅

**File Modified:** `app/(dashboard)/inspections/new/page.tsx`

**Change:**
- Inspection submission now sets `action_type='inspection_defect'` when creating actions for failed items
- Ensures inspection defects immediately appear in Workshop Tasks module

---

### 6. Actions Page Transition ✅

**File Modified:** `app/(dashboard)/actions/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Filters out workshop tasks (`action_type` IN `inspection_defect`, `workshop_vehicle_task`)
- Displays manager-only actions (`action_type='manager_action'` or null)
- Shows prominent notice if workshop tasks exist:
  - Info card with count of workshop tasks
  - "Open Workshop Tasks" button
  - Clear messaging about module transition

---

### 7. Database Types ✅

**File Modified:** `types/database.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated `actions` table Row/Insert/Update types:
  - Added `action_type`, `vehicle_id`, `workshop_category_id`, `workshop_comments`
- Added `workshop_task_categories` table types:
  - Row, Insert, Update interfaces

---

### 8. Testing ✅

**File Created:** `tests/integration/workshop-tasks-rls.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- Category RLS: Read, Create, Update, Delete
- Workshop Tasks RLS: Create, Read, Update, Complete
- Action type filtering
- Inspection defect creation
- Permission verification
- Data integrity (constraints, references)
- Index performance

---

## How to Use

### For Workshop Staff:
1. Navigate to "Workshop Tasks" from dashboard or top nav
2. View pending tasks from inspections or create manual tasks
3. Click "Mark In Progress" to start work (add short note)
4. Click "Complete" when work is finished
5. Use filters to find specific tasks by vehicle or status

### For Managers/Admins:
1. All workshop staff capabilities, plus:
2. Access "Settings" tab to manage categories
3. Create custom categories for different types of work
4. Enable/disable categories as needed
5. Reorder categories by sort_order

### For Inspectors:
- When submitting inspections with defects, actions are automatically created as `inspection_defect` type
- These appear in Workshop Tasks module immediately

---

## Migration Execution

The migration was successfully executed:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-workshop-tasks-migration.ts
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Created workshop_task_categories table
- ✅ Extended actions table with workshop fields
- ✅ Added RLS policies for workshop access
- ✅ Backfilled existing inspection defects
- ✅ Added role_permissions for workshop-tasks module
- ✅ Created indexes for performance

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- Reused existing `actions` table instead of creating parallel `workshop_tasks` table
- Ensures consistency and simplifies queries
- Inspection defects and workshop tasks share same workflow

### 2. Action Type Strategy
- `inspection_defect`: Auto-created from inspections
- `workshop_vehicle_task`: Manual workshop entries
- `manager_action`: Non-workshop manager tasks (future use)

### 3. Status Workflow
- Reused existing statuses: `pending`, `logged`, `completed`
- UI displays `logged` as "In Progress" for clarity
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 4. Category System
- Editable by managers/admins only
- Default "Uncategorised" category for flexibility
- Future-proof with `applies_to` field (vehicle/plant/tools)

### 5. Permissions Model
- New `workshop-tasks` module permission
- Managers/admins auto-granted
- Can be explicitly granted to workshop staff roles
- RLS enforces at database level

---

## Future Enhancements (Deferred)

- ❌ Plant machinery tasks
- ❌ Tool repair tracking
- ❌ Task assignment to specific staff
- ❌ Time tracking / labor hours
